  description: 'Side Project Society is one of things I am most proud of. I started this community with 2 friends of mine back in 2022. My friends and I work on a ton of side projects together. But we wanted a way to bring more people in so we could collaborate and learn from each other. So we started an in-person community called, Side Project Society. This group meets once a month and consistently brings in over 40 people (technical and non-technical) with all sorts of backgrounds. Each meeting we bring in a speaker who is either a SME or founder to talk about their experiences and share insight.',

  description: 'Code Launch is a giant start up competition that travels around the country. Once a year it comes to Houston. The event has 7 startups compete against each other where judges and attendees vote for their favorites. Each startup is given a 4-person hackathon team for 24 hours. The hackathon teams job is to build a prototype where the startup will demo on stage in front of thousands of people. I have been on the Code Launch hackathon team for the past 3 years (2022-2024). One year, I was even team lead.',
